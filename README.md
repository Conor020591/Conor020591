My repositories are aranged so that the first word in each title is the project it belongs to. The words after the first "_" indicate the skills and type of work that is done in the project.

This allows the projects to be organized as well as giving a descriptor to anyone going through them.

Here I will give a working order and description for the LegoSet project:

1. LegoSet_DataScraping - This is what I used to scrape the data used in the project from the Bricklink website
2. LegoSet_EDA_DataClean - Here I looked through the data, found which features were important, and removed products that were not actually legosets (books, art supplies, etc.)
3. LegoSet_LinearRegression - I did a basic linear regression on the data, including 2nd order polynomials. I created a testing methodology for finding the optimum encoding for categorical data
4. LegoSet_OtherSK-Learn - In this project I have used other scikit-learn models to analyze the lego data.
